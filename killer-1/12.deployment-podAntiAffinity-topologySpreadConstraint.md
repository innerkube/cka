# 12. Deployment on all Nodes

```

Use context: 

kubectl config use-context k8s-c1-H

```


## Question

```
Use Namespace project-tiger for the following. Create a Deployment named deploy-important with label id=very-important (the Pods should also have this label) and 3 replicas. It should contain two containers, the first named container1 with image nginx:1.17.6-alpine and the second one named container2 with image google/pause.

There should be only ever one Pod of that Deployment running on one worker node. We have two worker nodes: cluster1-node1 and cluster1-node2. Because the Deployment has three replicas the result should be that on both nodes one Pod is running. The third Pod won't be scheduled, unless a new worker node will be added. Use topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname for this.

In a way we kind of simulate the behaviour of a DaemonSet here, but using a Deployment and a fixed number of replicas.

```

## Solution

```
There are two possible ways, one using podAntiAffinity and one using topologySpreadConstraint.

```


## 1) PodAntiAffinity

The idea here is that we create a "Inter-pod anti-affinity" which allows us to say a Pod should only be scheduled on a node where another Pod of a specific label (here the same label) is not already running.

Let's begin by creating the Deployment template:

```
k -n project-tiger create deployment \
  --image=nginx:1.17.6-alpine deploy-important $do > 12.yaml

vim 12.yaml
```

### Then change the yaml to:


```

# 12.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    id: very-important                  # change
  name: deploy-important
  namespace: project-tiger              # important
spec:
  replicas: 3                           # change
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      id: very-important                # change
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        id: very-important              # change
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:1.17.6-alpine
        name: container1                # change
        resources: {}
      - image: google/pause             # add
        name: container2                # add
      affinity:                                             # add
        podAntiAffinity:                                    # add
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:   # add
          - labelSelector:                                  # add
              matchExpressions:                             # add
              - key: id                                     # add
                operator: In                                # add
                values:                                     # add
                - very-important                            # add
            topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname             # add
status: {}

```

Specify a topologyKey, which is a pre-populated Kubernetes label, you can find this by describing a node.


## TopologySpreadConstraints

We can achieve the same with topologySpreadConstraints. Best to try out and play with both.

```
# 12.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    id: very-important                  # change
  name: deploy-important
  namespace: project-tiger              # important
spec:
  replicas: 3                           # change
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      id: very-important                # change
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        id: very-important              # change
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:1.17.6-alpine
        name: container1                # change
        resources: {}
      - image: google/pause             # add
        name: container2                # add
      topologySpreadConstraints:                 # add
      - maxSkew: 1                               # add
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname      # add
        whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule         # add
        labelSelector:                           # add
          matchLabels:                           # add
            id: very-important                   # add
status: {}

```


## Apply and Run

```
// Let's run it:

kubectl create -f 12.yaml

// Then we check the Deployment status where it shows 2/3 ready count:

kubectl -n project-tiger get deploy -l id=very-important

NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deploy-important   2/3     3            2           2m35s


// And running the following we see one Pod on each worker node and one not scheduled.

kubectl -n project-tiger get pod -o wide -l id=very-important

NAME                                READY   STATUS    ...   NODE             
deploy-important-58db9db6fc-9ljpw   2/2     Running   ...   cluster1-node1
deploy-important-58db9db6fc-lnxdb   0/2     Pending   ...   <none>          
deploy-important-58db9db6fc-p2rz8   2/2     Running   ...   cluster1-node2

```

If we kubectl describe the Pod deploy-important-58db9db6fc-lnxdb it will show us the reason for not scheduling is our implemented podAntiAffinity ruling:


```
Warning  FailedScheduling  63s (x3 over 65s)  default-scheduler  0/3 nodes are available: 1 node(s) had taint {node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: }, that the pod didn't tolerate, 2 node(s) didn't match pod affinity/anti-affinity, 2 node(s) didn't satisfy existing pods anti-affinity rules


// Or our topologySpreadConstraints:

Warning  FailedScheduling  16s   default-scheduler  0/3 nodes are available: 1 node(s) had taint {node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: }, that the pod didn't tolerate, 2 node(s) didn't match pod topology spread constraints.


```
