# 14.Find out Cluster Information

```
You're ask to find out following information about the cluster k8s-c1-H:

How many controlplane nodes are available?

How many worker nodes are available?

What is the Service CIDR?

Which Networking (or CNI Plugin) is configured and where is its config file?

Which suffix will static pods have that run on cluster1-node1?

Write your answers into file /opt/course/14/cluster-info, structured like this:

```

## Answer

```
// How many controlplane and worker nodes are available?

➜ k get node
NAME                    STATUS   ROLES          AGE   VERSION
cluster1-controlplane1  Ready    control-plane  27h   v1.30.1
cluster1-node1          Ready    <none>         27h   v1.30.1
cluster1-node2          Ready    <none>         27h   v1.30.1

1: 1

2: 2


// What is the Service CIDR?

➜ ssh cluster1-controlplane1

➜ root@cluster1-controlplane1:~# cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml | grep range
    - --service-cluster-ip-range=10.96.0.0/12

3: 10.96.0.0/12



// Which Networking (or CNI Plugin) is configured and where is its config file?

find /etc/cni/net.d/
/etc/cni/net.d/
/etc/cni/net.d/10-calico.conflist

cat /etc/cni/net.d/10-calico.conflist

4: calico, /etc/cni/net.d/10-calico.conflist


// Which suffix will static pods have that run on cluster1-node1?

5. -cluster1-node1

The suffix is the node hostname with a leading hyphen. It used to be -static in earlier Kubernetes versions.
