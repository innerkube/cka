# 15.Cluster Event Logging

```
Write a command into /opt/course/15/cluster_events.sh which shows the latest events in the whole cluster, ordered by time (metadata.creationTimestamp). Use kubectl for it.

Now delete the kube-proxy Pod running on node cluster2-node1 and write the events this caused into /opt/course/15/pod_kill.log.

Finally kill the containerd container of the kube-proxy Pod on node cluster2-node1 and write the events into /opt/course/15/container_kill.log.

Do you notice differences in the events both actions caused?

```

# Solution

```

$ /opt/course/15/cluster_events.sh
kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp


$ Now we delete the kube-proxy Pod:

kubectl -n kube-system get pod -o wide | grep proxy

kubectl -n kube-system delete pod kube-proxy-zxvzxcv


$ Now check the events:

sh /opt/course/15/cluster_events.sh


$ Write the events the killing caused into /opt/course/15/pod_kill.log:
$ /opt/course/15/pod_kill.log

kube-system   9s          Normal    Killing           pod/kube-proxy-jsv7t   ...
kube-system   3s          Normal    SuccessfulCreate  daemonset/kube-proxy   ...
kube-system   <unknown>   Normal    Scheduled         pod/kube-proxy-m52sx   ...
default       2s          Normal    Starting          node/cluster2-node1  ...
kube-system   2s          Normal    Created           pod/kube-proxy-m52sx   ...
kube-system   2s          Normal    Pulled            pod/kube-proxy-m52sx   ...
kube-system   2s          Normal    Started           pod/kube-proxy-m52sx   ...

$ Finally we will try to provoke events by killing the container belonging to the container of the kube-proxy Pod:

➜ ssh cluster2-node1

➜ root@cluster2-node1:~# crictl ps | grep kube-proxy
1e020b43c4423   36c4ebbc9d979   About an hour ago   Running   kube-proxy     ...

➜ root@cluster2-node1:~# crictl rm 1e020b43c4423
1e020b43c4423

➜ root@cluster2-node1:~# crictl ps | grep kube-proxy
0ae4245707910   36c4ebbc9d979   17 seconds ago      Running   kube-proxy     ...   


$ We killed the main container (1e020b43c4423), but also noticed that a new container (0ae4245707910) was directly created. Thanks Kubernetes!

$ Now we see if this caused events again and we write those into the second file:

sh /opt/course/15/cluster_events.sh

# /opt/course/15/container_kill.log
kube-system   13s         Normal    Created      pod/kube-proxy-m52sx    ...
kube-system   13s         Normal    Pulled       pod/kube-proxy-m52sx    ...
kube-system   13s         Normal    Started      pod/kube-proxy-m52sx    ...

```

Comparing the events we see that when we deleted the whole Pod there were more things to be done, hence more events. For example was the DaemonSet in the game to re-create the missing Pod. Where when we manually killed the main container of the Pod, the Pod would still exist but only its container needed to be re-created, hence less events.
